# sw-gym-sockets
As I see the software skills as muscles, this is my gym where I train them.

This project is part of my sw-gym exercises. It covers areas such as C++, sockets, and CMake. Further, it covers some NFRs such as modularity, scalability, and ease of testing. 
Building things from scratch in the stress-free time is important - it works as "active recall". However, in industry, we need to reuse existing libraries to be more productive and catch the market faster than other competitors ;)

TODO:
- Use Conan
- Use DocTest
- Add Dockerfile
- Refactor code ;)
- TBD
